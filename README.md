# Dandere2x - Faster Waifu2x Video Upscaling


## What is Dandere2x? 

Dandere2x is a lossy compression architecture specific for waifu2x. The goal of Dandere2x is to speed up waifu2x video processing by implementing traditional video compression techniques. 

In other words, Dandere2x reduces the time needed to process a video using waifu2x.

## Current Features

- Block Matching Video Compression

- Interpolated Frame Video Compression

- Minimum / maximum quality loss

- Custom block sizes

- Custom scaling sizes (1x, 2x, 3x).

## Development Status

Dandere2x is written natively on ubuntu Linux but is ported and released on windows. I hope to have an official Linux release soon, but for the time being the windows version is easier to configure.

The project is currently in alpha right now and is ready for testing (windows).
