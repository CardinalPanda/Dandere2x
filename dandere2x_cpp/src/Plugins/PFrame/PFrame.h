/**
 * Description:
 *
 * This is where the magic happens boy. This is honestly the core of Dandere2x -
 * we're given two images, and we try our best to create the second image using parts of the first
 * image. We document the parts that we could not reproduce ('Differences')  to be upscaled by
 * waifu2x, while everything else is recycled
 *
 *
 * Inputs:
 *
 * - image1 is the image we're trying to recycle parts from
 *
 * - image2 is the desired image we're trying to achieve
 *
 * Runtime:
 *
 * - If image1 and image2 are similiar enough, (we do this with a basic PSNR check),
 *   we try to identify where the blocks move in image1 to create image2
 *
 * - Once we know that image2 can be created from pieces of image1, we draw over those pieces
 *   into image2, creating a new image (that is noiser image) than true image2.
 *
 * Outputs:
 *
 * - A series of vectors to create image2 out of pieces using image1
 *
 * - Draw over image2 using pieces found in image1 (if it is correct)
 *
 * - A series of vectors to denote the parts of image2 that could not be drawn
 *   using parts of image1, so Waifu2x can re-upscale those parts
 *
