/**
 * Description:
 *
 * We know what blocks did get recycled between two frames, but we need to identify what blocks could not
 * be recycled in order to re-draw these parts for waifu2x
 *
 *
 * Inputs:
 *
 * 1) std::vector<Block> &blocks
 *
 *   All the blocks in this 'blocks' are 'accepted blocks' produced by block matching.
 *   Since we know what blocks DID get accepted, we need to find what blocks didn't.
 *
 * Runtime:
 *
 * - We need to know what pixels in the output image are empty, and we do this by flagging all the pixels
 *   that are covered because of blocks
 *
 * - We need to know how many pixels are missing in order to create the output image
 *
 * - Pixel by pixel, if a pixel is not marked as 'drawn' by a block, we need to add the block
 *   we're currently observing into the 'Difference Blocks' Object
 *
 *
 * Outcome:
 *
 * - A series of vectors that denote what parts of image2 could not be created using parts of image1
 *
 *
 * Comments:
 *
 * - This is the closest thing to legacy code there is in my project. It's utterly confusing as shit to me
 *   and I always have to re-read my own docs to understand what is going on here.
 *
