Dandere2x Overview
==================

Dandere2x reduces the time needed for Waifu2x to upscale animation (sometimes live-action) videos by applying compression techniques. Just as Netflix uses compression to quickly stream videos to your home, Dandere2x uses compression to expedite the waifu2x upscaling process.

Fast
    Dandere2x can provide a dramatic speedup for anime upscaling.
    In this comparison video_,  Dandere2x took only 3.5 minutes, while 
    using Video2x's lossless upscaling took 18 minutes!

Easy
   Dandere2x comes included with a GUI interface to make Dandere2x easy and fast to use, for both experienced and inexperienced users.
   
Customizable and Open Source
    Dandere2x is highly customizable and modifiable. In theory, Dandere2x can be applied to any CNN based upscaling algorithm -
    not just Waifu2x! Experienced users are also free to play with the .json file to find settings that best suits their needs.
